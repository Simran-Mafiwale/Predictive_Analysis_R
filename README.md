# Predictive_Analysis_R
Developed predictive models in R to anticipate outcomes and optimize decisions across diverse domains using robust statistical and machine learning techniques.

1.	Project Overview: Predictive Modelling for Real Estate Pricing
In this project, we leverage predictive modelling techniques to build a robust model that predicts property prices based on various features.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for property prices using the `housing_train.csv` dataset. Subsequently, this model will be used to predict prices for the properties in the `housing_test.csv` dataset, where the price information is not provided. The predicted prices will then be submitted as a CSV file.

Approach:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
   - Explore the `housing_train.csv` dataset to understand its structure, features, and relationships.
   - Perform data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Feature Selection and Engineering:
   - Identify relevant features that significantly impact property prices through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical techniques.
   - Engineer new features if necessary, such as creating interaction terms or deriving new variables from existing ones.
3. Model Building:
   - Selected Linear Regression machine learning algorithms for regression tasks.
   - Evaluate it on performance metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
4. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the trained models using the `housing_train.csv` dataset with suitable evaluation metrics to ensure robust performance.
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results and interpretability.
5. Prediction 
   - Apply the selected model to predict property prices for the properties in the `housing_test.csv` dataset.
   - Store the predicted prices in a CSV file format.

Conclusion:
By developing and deploying a predictive model for property pricing, this project aims to equip real estate firms with a powerful tool to optimize pricing strategies and enhance decision-making in property development and sales.



2.	Project Overview: Predictive Modelling for Store Opening
In this project, we aim to build a predictive model that determines the feasibility of opening a store using machine learning techniques.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using the `store_train.csv` dataset to predict whether a store should be opened (response variable 'store'). Subsequently, this model will be used to predict store openings for the locations in the `store_test.csv` dataset, where the 'store' information is not provided. The predicted values will then be submitted as a CSV file.

Approach:
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
   - Explore the `store_train.csv` dataset to understand its structure, features, and relationships.
   - Perform data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Feature Selection and Engineering:
   - Identify relevant features that influence store openings through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and domain knowledge.
   - Engineer new features if necessary, such as deriving metrics related to sales performance, population density, or geographical proximity.
3. Model Building:
   - Selected Logistic Regression machine learning algorithms for classification tasks. 
   - Evaluate the model based on AUC Score.
4. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the trained models using the `store_train.csv` dataset with appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure reliable performance.
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results and interpretability.
5. Prediction:
   - Apply the selected model to predict whether stores should be opened for the locations in the `store_test.csv` dataset.
   - Store the predicted 'store' values (whether to open or not) in a CSV file format.

Conclusion:
By developing and deploying a predictive model for store openings, this project aims to provide retail stakeholders with a data-driven approach to make informed decisions about expanding their store network, optimizing resource allocation, and maximizing profitability.
